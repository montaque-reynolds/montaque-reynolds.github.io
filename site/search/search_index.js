Phil 1700 invites students to explore enduring philosophical questions and to reflectively evaluate the various answers given them by thinkers from a range of social, historical, and religious contexts. Students will tackle ultimate questions in a range of philosophical domains, including issues such as the nature of self and ultimate reality, morality and human meaning, rationality and the pursuit of truth. The aim of the course is to give students an opportunity to critically examine their own beliefs and commitments in dialogue with each other and with great thinkers past and present.

In preparation for this, this weeks reading will only be pages 131---141 of Ethics<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>You are then going to summarize this reading using what is called the 4 sentence philosophy paper.</p> <p>(1) They say __________, because __________. (2) I say __________, because __________. (3) One might object that __________. (4) I reply that __________</p> <p>These four sentences here are meant to be complete grammatically correct sentences. In otherwords, your job is to fill in the blanks.</p> <p>This is where the argument forms we used last week can come in handy. What goes in the first blank is the conclusion of the argument. We might say something like: Socrates was mortal. Then ask why the author thinks that Socrates was mortal; The author says that Socrates was mortal because she believes that all men are mortal.</p> <p>Then think about whether you agree or disagree. Remember what we said about validity and soundness. These are two ways that you can critize an argument. Either the premises do not support the conclusion, or one or more of them are false. In the example above, you maybe think that not all men are mortal.</p> <ul> <li> <p>I say that her argument is unsound because dead men are not mortal.</p> </li> <li> <p>One might object that dead men are not men.</p> </li> <li> <p>I reply that dead men, in virtue of the fact that we can them dead men, must be men who are dead.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This may be more difficult than it looks. The reason why is that your job is to take all of the points Kant makes in the reading, and boil it down to the primary one. What is the one claim he defends? Then look for the one reason he uses to defend that claim.</p> <p>It will most likely be very helpful for you to read the whole chapter. What this means, is that you are reading a number of pages in order to understand one sentence worth of material.

So while Irving deserves praise for exercising his bodily rights, Tillman deserves praise for giving up his rights.</p> <p>Second, which aspects of this praise belong to the person, and which to the circumstances?

What this means, is that instead of applying what have learned in the classroom at home, working on a problem, writing a paper, etc., you will instead apply what you have learned at home, in the classroom. This is an effective way to learn the information because you are getting a chance to apply it right away. I will provide ample opportunity for you to apply in class what you have learned at home. This includes assignments, discussion participation, reading feedback (i.e., this reading was difficult because . . .). Each of these aspects will together comprise your grade in the course. Ultimately, what you learn, and the grade you will receive, will be up to you. You will get as much out of this course as you put in.</p> <p>Your participation grade will be a cumulation of the points you\u2019ve earned on each of the assignments, plus those points you earned through participation and attendance. The effect of this typically, is that if you are on the boarder between one grade you do not want, and a grade that you do, the attendance and participation will either bump your grade up, or leave it were it is.</p> <p>Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this class. Just as important however, is reading the material and take notes! The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during discussions and group exercises, \u00a9 level of engagement on discord, and (d) the completion of other exercises.</p> <p>Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit.

If you click on the link, you can make a copy of and save the rubric to your own google drive account if you have one. If you do not, and you would still like to be able to calculate your own score on an assignment, it is easy to do. For each of the items on the rubric, e.g., \u201cconclusion\u201d, I will assign a score between 1 and 4. If your conclusion on an assignment, for instance \u201cties up loose ends\u201d, but does not \u201cconsider obvious objections\u201d, I will give you a 3 rather than a 4 for the \u201cconclusion item.\u201d Add up the scores that you received for each of the items, divide it by the possible total, depending on the rubric, either 12 or 40, and multiply that number by .1.

If you take notes on your computer, then you can have it open. However for this course, I will expect you to take notes by hand. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing course software, readings, and notes. There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content (Hembrooke and Gay 2003) and lower overall course performance (Fried 2008). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student\u2019s laptop also have decreased performance in courses (Sana et al. 2013). Conversely, students who take notes the \u201cold fashioned way\u201d have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them.
