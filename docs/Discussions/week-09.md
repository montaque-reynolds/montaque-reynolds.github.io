# Week 9 - Caring

## Feminist Thought and the Ethics of Care

##### 9.1 Feminist thought and ethical inquiry.

* Feminist Thought
* Feminist Ethical Theory

There are various systems that govern human behaviors. These systems govern what we take to be our norms, expectations, beliefs, values. These include cultural, political, familial, relational, legal, ideological, and other social systems. A cultural system may be expressed when the primary care giver for a younger version of you, does or does not read to you before bed. There may be a cultural norm that implies that one should or should not read to their dependents before bedtime.

There are also other, certain voter dispositions implied by cultural norms, that one should follow based on one's race, age and gender. Should older caucasion individuals vote conservative? Should younger ones vote liberal? These are normative and descriptive questions that that the facts about our governing systems raise. Do African Americans have an obligation to vote liberal?

There are two distinct properties of feminist moral critique. The first is intellectual where the behavioral and norms of governance in human societies are critiqued and evaluated based on the benefits and harms for women that they represent. The second is political in that the practitioners of feminist critiques seek to correct for any harms that women may experience as a result of harmful systemic norms.

Two broadly practical aims for practitioners of feminist critiques:

1. End Sexism
2. Seek Justice for Women

But there are additional ones as well, not as broadly practical:

1. Promote the well-being of women.

What is the critique against?

There are two kinds of ethical approach with respect to their target. Masculine theories often obscure the identities of its targets. Focusing instead on:

* Autonomy
* Impartiality
* Neutrality

As such, masculine approaches have the advantage of being applied to all, or at least most. They also have clear targets, the majority, those defined by our ethical obligations, whoever it would be virtuous to target with our ethical behaviors, etc.

However, it has shortcomings:

1. Often very unintuitive
2. Ignores our special relationships, friendships, lovers, personal properties and other personal attachments
3. No defined targets

##### 9.2 Feminist criticisms of traditional views about ethics and moral development.


More Criticisms

* Gender normativity
* Gender Essentialism

What is gender? What is Sex? Is gender an essential characteristic of one's sex?

According to @fial24:

* Sex = biological, connected to genitalia, chromosomes
* Gender: cultural and social notions of masculinity or femininity.

Two questions, is sex essential, binary, is gender binary?

Trans, but what about intersex?

Why are these questions correlated with questions about justice, rights, equality for women?

##### 9.3 Evaluate the ethics of care.

Are normative requirements for expressions of morality based on one's gender?

Traditionally:

Women: More feminine, feminine = caring
Men: Judges impartially

Held:

Meeting the needs of particular others under one's care

* Children
* Aging Parents

Is there are normative standard for who takes care of the personal needs in a home, among family members?

Carol Gilligan:

Men and Women have different kinds of ethics. Women reason more relationally, men more abstractly, conceptual notions of moral terms etc.
