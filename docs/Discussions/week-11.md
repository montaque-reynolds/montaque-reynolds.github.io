## A case of Velvet Eugenics

We've read Rosemarie Garland-Thomson's concern of eugenics being made possible with technologies like CRISPR. The worry is that parents will only give birth to children who personify their specific and pointed ideas of what is healthy. However, as a society, we have often gotten this wrong. Our notions of health, intelligence, human value, are often wrong and it is only latter that we understand this to be the case.

The articles linked here are some explorations and considerations regarding whether or not we do stigmatize people and whether our desires to treat human illness are really just attempts to enforce our own misguided ideas of health onto others.
